Determine the passenger(s) having had the highest number of flights.
For this task you are expected to implement a MapReduce-like executable prototype, (in Java,
C, C++, or Python). The objective is to develop the basic functional ‘building-blocks’ that will
address the Task above, in a way that emulates the MapReduce/Hadoop framework i.e.
executing MapReduce without deploying the Hadoop Cluster.
Write a brief report (no more than 3 pages, excluding any appendices), describing:
• The high-level description of the development of the prototype software.
• A simple description of the version control processes undertaken.
• A detailed description of the MapReduce functions implemented.
• The output format of any reports that the job is to produce.
The solution may use multi-threading as required. The marking scheme reflects the appropriate
use of coding techniques, succinct code comments as required, data structures and overall
program design. The code should be subject to version control best-practices using a hosted
repository under your university username.
Although students at the MSc level would be expected to have sufficient programming skills in
Python/Java to be able to implement the required code for this task which is typically not complex,
there are however ample tutorial resources available on the course site on BB, including worked
examples and videos of walkthrough of typical code in both Python and Java as well as plenty of
text and links to external resources to support the required programming for this task, including
tutorial resources and support for threading control.
